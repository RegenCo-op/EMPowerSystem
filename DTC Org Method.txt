Diagnostic Trouble Code Organizational Methodology 

Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) are a ten digit alpha numeric code that is set and stored in memory when sensor readings are out of their normal range
or are within range but not reading the value that is expected based upon actuator commands or readings from other sensors. 
This is explained in detail in the Trouble Shooting section of this Wiki
It is also in the Trouble Shooting section of this Wiki where it is explained how these codes are used to diagnose and fix problems with the EMPowerSystem.

The ten digits are split into Identifier Blocks of two digits each: 01 23 45 67 89 

Because each digit can be represented by 0-9 and A-Z  there are 10+26=36 possible combinations per digit.
Each Identifier Block having two digits of 36 possible combinations has a total  of 36*36=1296 possible combinations per Identifier Block 
This could be expanded further by including a-z and other ASCII symbols such as &,%,$,# etc.

Each block represents the following:

Identifier Block : Identifier Class

01               : Network Identifier
23               : Module Identifier
45               : Sub-System, Sub-Module or Slave-Module Identifier
67               : Component Identifier
89               : Fault Identifier

The Network Identifier identifies the network the DTC was set on. Not all DTCs are shared between all networks, only the networks associated with a DTC are shared the DTC.  
The Network Identifier is an assignment value. The Local Network must generate a unique Internet IP address number to identify itself.
This number is then assigned the value 00 as its Network Identifier. Each External Network the Local Network integrates with will be assigned a Network Identifier in order by first contact.
So the first External Network integrated with would have its IP address assigned as 01, the second External Network integrated with would have its IP address assigned as 02 etc.

As a table it looks like this:

Network Identifier : Network IP address 
00                 : 127.255.255.255 (Local Network)
01                 : 489.001.569.421 (first External Network) 
02				   : 300.005.021.601 (second External Network)
Etc.               : Etc.

The Module Identifier identifies the module on the network that set the DTC.
Not all DTCs are shared between all Modules, only the Modules associated with the DTC and the User Interface Hub, Setup and Diagnostics Module are shared the DTC.

Current Module Identifiers are as followed:

Module Identifier : Module Name
00                : User Interface Module
01                : User Interface Hub, Setup and Diagnostics Module
02                : Thermal Fluid Collector and Storage Module
03                : Weather Monitoring Module
04                : Photo-voltaic Charge Controller Module 
05                : Wind Charge Controller Module
06				  : Battery Charge Monitor Module
05                : Bio-Digester Module
06                : Bio-Reactor Module
07                : Greenhouse Module
08                : Garden Module
09                : Pond Module
10                : Aquaponics Module
11                : HVAC Module
As new Modules are created they will be added to this list

The Sub-System or Sub-Module Identifier identifies the Sub-System or Sub-Module of the module that set the DTC

There are two Sub-System Identifiers:

Sub-System Identifier : Sub-System Name
00                    : Input
01                    : Output

A Sub-Module is any device (other than a Slave-Module, explained below) connected to a Module that communicates via a Dedicated Communication Bus

Current Sub-Module Identifiers are as followed:

Sub-Module Identifier : Sub-Module Name
02                    : Data Logger Sub-Module
03                    : Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Sub-Module
04                    : Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor Sub-Module
Etc.                  : Etc.

A Slave-Module is identical (or performs the same main function) as the "Master" Module that over-arches it. 
To allow the Sub-System and Sub-Module Identifiers of the Slave-Module the first Slave-Module Identifier digit is A and the second digit denotes the Sub-System or Sub-Module as follows:

Slave-Module Identifier : Slave-Module Sub-System or Sub-Module Name
A0                      : Slave-Module A Input
A1                      : Slave-Module A Output
A2	                    : Slave-Module A Data Logger Sub-Module
Etc.                    : Etc.
B0                      : Slave-Module B Input
B1                      : Slave-Module B Output
B2	                    : Slave-Module B Data Logger Sub-Module
Etc.                    : Etc.
