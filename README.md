# EMPowerSystem Ecological Modern Power System
Goal: A modular scalable system that maximizes efficiency by monitoring and controlling material and energy streams
Modularity and scalability and the monitoring and control strategies need to range from individual households and craft industries to cities and factories. 
Initial focus will concentrate on the small end scale of a homestead and continually incorporate larger realms. 
With access and control of ones energy requirements the potential for an improved standard of living is possible.
